Basically there are two ways to play music

* to play direclty by `mpg123`

    Under this mode, music will be played by forking `mpg123` directly. Sorry currently there is no way to configure which music player to use.

    * `douban.fm` will play anonymous playlist of channel 0
    * `douban.fm -c 1` will play channel 1
    * `douban.fm -u xxx@xxx.com -p xxx` will play private playlist
    * `douban.fm -u xxx@xxx.com -p xxx -c 1` will play channel 1 but with your account signed in
    * `douban.fm -u xxx@xx.com -p` will play private playlist but will ask for your password to sign in

* to play by [Music Player Daemon](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki)

    Under this mode, URL of music will be sent to MPD which will actually play. Whenever there are less than _10_ songs in MPD playlist, more will be retrieved from douban.fm.

    It is fantastic to use MPD since there are quite many [clients](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients) to use. I am now just use my iPhone with [MPoD2](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:MPoD2).

    Thanks for @tdsparrow pointing out MPD, otherwise I might have been doing some really stupid things.

    * `douban.fm -m` will play anonymous playlist of channel 0
    * `douban.fm -m -c 1` will play channel 1
    * `douban.fm -m -u xxx@xxx.com -p xxx` will play private playlist
    * `douban.fm -m -u xxx@xxx.com -p xxx -c 1` will play channel 1 but with your account signed in
    * `douban.fm -m -u xxx@xx.com -p` will play private playlist but will ask for your password to sign in
    * if "-m -i" is provided, a web server will start listening on 3000 by default, and you may
        * GET /channels to get all available channels
        * GET /now to get current playing channel
        * GET /channel/<id> to switch to channel of the specified id, if id is -1, channel will be selected randomly
          each time fetching playlist
        * GET / or /index to view channel switch pannel
